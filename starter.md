* These datasets are sourced from the SF government. While you can find them via [SF OpenData](https://data.sfgov.org/), it seems that they are experiencing private connection issues. As a result, the data is download from the [ftp server](ttp://apps.sfgov.org/datafiles/index.php?dir=sfgis) directly.
