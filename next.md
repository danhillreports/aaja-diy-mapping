## Where to go from here?

1. **Practice making simple maps.** You can follow [CartoDB tutorials](http://docs.cartodb.com/tutorials.html) that are tagged as basic. You will learn the interface of CartoDB, and hopefully understand some data concepts along the way.

2. **If you want to understand how datasets work together, learn SQL.** Check out CartoDB's medium/advanced tutorials. To get a solid grasp of SQL, Khan academy provides a great [intro course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql).

3. **If you want to get into map design/cartography, write more CartoCSS by hand.** Start with a map that you have made, and see how it can be visualized differently. (You can do so by adding more styles to the CartoCSS tab in CartoDB. [CartoCSS reference](https://github.com/mapbox/carto/blob/master/docs/latest.md)) 
  - If you are feeling adventurous, check out [MapBox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/#darwin) for some serious styling.
