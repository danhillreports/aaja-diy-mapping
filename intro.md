### But remember

## What goes into a map?

### Geometries

- Point
- Line
- Polygon

### Coordinates/Projections

- on the earth: longitude, latitude

- projected **on the screen**: x, y

### Data associated with geometries

- This is data: [21,107,196 miles of roads world wide](https://www.mapbox.com/osm-data-report/)

### Data concepts

- Join
  - "How many houses are foreclosed in a census track?"
- Spatial Join
  - "How many collisions have happened in the 1-mile radius of the school?"

## Tools

These tools/platforms allow you to use data spatially:

- QGIS
- CartoDB
- MapBox

## Where to begin?

- Think about a subject of your interest.
- Look into data. Learn about it.
- Does it need to be a map?
- Use some tool to manipulate, and visualize the spatial information.
